<h2>THE TALE OF<br />
BENNY BADGER</h2><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[1]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>I</h2>

<h3>A GREAT DIGGER</h3>


<p>Of course, Benny Badger had the best
of reasons for living on the high, dry
plains. There he had for neighbors
plenty of ground squirrels and prairie
dogs. And it is likely that he enjoyed
their company much more than they did
his.</p>

<p>If anyone had asked them, those little
wild people would no doubt have confessed
that they wished Benny Badger
was somewhere else. But their wishes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
meant nothing to Benny&mdash;if he knew anything
of them. Although he couldn't help
noticing that his small neighbors hurried
into their homes whenever they caught
sight of him, Benny never took the hint
and went away. On the contrary, when
he spied a prairie dog or a ground squirrel
disappearing into his burrow Benny
was more than ready to go right in after
him.</p>

<p>Now, the tunnels that led to the houses
of those smaller folk were too small to
admit anybody as bulky as Benny Badger.
But that difficulty never hindered
Benny. Digging was the easiest thing he
did. He had a powerful body, short,
stout legs, and big feet, which bore long,
strong claws. And when he started to dig
his way into somebody else's home he certainly
did make the dirt fly.</p>

<p>He was so fond of digging that he even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
dug countless holes of his own, just for
the fun it gave him&mdash;so far as anybody
could find out. And if he had only left
other folk's holes alone some of his neighbors
would not have objected to his favorite
sport. For more than one fox and
coyote had been known to make his home
in a hole dug by Benny Badger. And,
though they never took the trouble to
thank him for saving them work, they often
chuckled about his odd way of having
fun, and remarked among themselves that
Benny must be a stupid fellow.</p>

<p>If they really thought that, they made
a great mistake. To be sure, at anything
except digging he was slow and awkward.
He was too heavy and squat to be spry
on his feet&mdash;to chase and catch his more
nimble neighbors. But no one that knew
much about Benny Badger would have
said that his wits were dull. They were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
sharp. And so, too, were his teeth, which
he never hesitated to use in a fight.</p>

<p>Left alone, Benny Badger&mdash;when he
wasn't too hungry&mdash;was a peaceable person.
But if a dog ever tried to worry
him Benny had a most unpleasant way of
seizing his annoyer with his powerful
jaws and holding the poor creature as if
he never intended to let him go.</p>

<p>Cornered, Benny knew no such thing as
fear. He had the heart of a lion, and jaws
like a steel trap. And no wise dog ever
let Benny get a good, firm grip on him.</p>

<p>Usually no one saw Benny Badger except
at night. He seldom left his den in
the daytime except to sun himself. And
even then not many noticed him. Though
he did not hide when anyone surprised
him while taking a sun-bath, he had a
trick of lying flat in the grass without
moving. And it took a sharp eye to spy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
him when he lay low in that fashion.</p>

<p>Curled up asleep, with his long fur on
end, he looked too comfortable to disturb.
At least, that was what the ground squirrels
thought. And if one of those busy
little fellows ever paused to stare curiously
at Benny when he was having a nap in
the warm sunshine, Benny Badger had
only to awake and turn his head toward
the onlooker to make him scamper for
home as fast as he could go.</p>

<p>It was not Benny's face, either, that
frightened the ground squirrels away,
though everybody had to admit that he
had a queer one. A black patch spread
over his eyes and ran like the point of a
V down his nose. For the most part, however,
he was of a grayish color, with still
more black running in streaks across his
back. Underneath he was a&mdash;yes! a dirty
white color. But then, one must remem<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>ber
that he was forever digging in the
dirt; and there was very little water
where he lived. Anyhow, he was particular
enough about one thing: his long
hair was always carefully parted in the
middle from his head to his tail.</p>

<p>And certainly that ought to show that
he tried to keep himself looking neat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>II</h2>

<h3>HUNTING FOR SOMETHING</h3>


<p>It was a pleasant summer's night. Anyone
would have supposed that it was just
the sort of weather that Benny Badger
might have chosen for digging holes. But
he must have thought that he had dug
enough holes for the time being. He wandered
about as if he had lost a hole somewhere
and couldn't find it. And whenever
he spied a hole made by one of his
smaller neighbors he stopped and looked
at it closely.</p>

<p>But none of them seemed to be the one
he was looking for. At least, Benny examined
a good many holes, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
passed on again, before he came to one at
last that was different from all the rest.
If you could have seen the look of pleasure
on Benny's odd face when he caught
sight of this particular hole you would
have known at once that his search had
come to an end.</p>

<p>Now, as a matter of fact, Benny Badger
had not lost a hole. His strange behavior
did not mean that. It meant that
he was searching for a <i>fresh</i> hole, which
some ground squirrel had dug so short a
time before that there couldn't be much
doubt that the small owner was then
living in it.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 274px;">
<img src="images/illus-1.jpg" width="274" height="400" alt="Mr. Ground Squirrel Escapes from Benny." title="Mr. Ground Squirrel Escapes from Benny." />
<span class="caption">Mr. Ground Squirrel Escapes from Benny.</span>
</div>

<p>To be sure, Benny might have dug his
way to the furthest end of each hole that
he found that night. And doubtless he
would have enjoyed such a pastime. But
as for finding a plump ground squirrel at
the end of every tunnel&mdash;ah! that would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
have been a different matter. No such
pleasant sight would have greeted Benny's
eyes. And on this evening he wanted
to find some such reward when his digging
came to an end.</p>

<p>He knew as well as he knew anything in
the world that newly scattered earth never
lay strewn about the doorway of an <i>old</i>
hole.</p>

<p>And that was the reason he passed by
so many holes with hardly more than a
swift glance.</p>

<p>But when at length he found what he
had been looking for&mdash;a hole with fresh
brown dirt scattered carelessly around it&mdash;Benny
Badger showed by every one of
his actions that he didn't intend to move
on until he had burrowed to the very end
of it.</p>

<p>A broad smile lighted up his queerly
marked face. At least, he opened his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
mouth and showed a good many of his
teeth. And a bright, eager glint came into
his eyes; whereas they had had a somewhat
wistful look before, as if their owner
might have been hungry, and didn't exactly
know where he was going to find a
meal.</p>

<p>Then Benny Badger looked all around,
to see whether anybody might be watching
him. But there was no one in sight.
And if there had been, Benny Badger
would have done no more than tell him
that he had better run along about his
business, because it would do him no good
to wait&mdash;none at all.</p>

<p>And if the onlooker had happened to
come so near as to bother Benny in what
he intended to do, that unfortunate person
might have wished that he had taken a
bit of friendly advice in time, and made
himself scarce.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>But, of course, Benny Badger was not
so foolish as to give any such warning,
for there was no one there to hear it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>III</h2>

<h3>NO ONE AT HOME</h3>


<p>Since there seemed to be nobody lurking
in the shadows around him, and watching
him, Benny Badger turned to the
ground squirrel's hole and began to dig.
How he did make the dirt fly! He scooped
it up with his big feet and flung it back in
a shower, not caring in the least where it
fell. For he was interested not in what
lay behind, but before him.</p>

<p>In almost less time than it takes to tell
about it, Benny Badger had made the entrance
of the tunnel so big that it swallowed
his head and shoulders.</p>

<p>Now, when some people do anything<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
they are forever stopping to see how
much they have finished, as if they hated
to work and wished that they didn't have
to. But Benny Badger was not like them.
He loved to dig. And instead of wishing
that it wasn't far to the ground squirrel's
chamber he kept hoping that it was a
good, long tunnel, so that he might have
plenty of fun digging his way to the end
of it.</p>

<p><i>He</i> didn't pause to look back at the pile
of dirt he had thrown behind him. In
fact, he didn't stop for anything&mdash;not
even to take a long breath&mdash;until he noticed
a sound that made him pause and
listen for a few moments.</p>

<p>It was a yapping, growling noise that
caught Benny Badger's ear&mdash;a noise that
changed, while he listened, to a howl, and
then suddenly ended as it had begun.</p>

<p>That call, coming as it did out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
night, would have frightened many
people. Not knowing just what it was,
they might have thought it sounded like
the cry of a wolf. But Benny Badger
showed not the least sign of fear. On the
contrary, he seemed almost angry with
himself because he had stopped even for
a few moments to listen.</p>

<p>"Oh, fudge!" he said&mdash;or something
a good deal like that. "It's nothing but
a Coyote."</p>

<p>And then he went to digging faster
than ever, to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>He hadn't been working long after that
when Mr. Coyote's call made him back out
of the hole and listen once more.</p>

<p>"Shucks!" said Benny Badger&mdash;or
something like that, anyhow. "He's coming
this way."</p>

<p>Anyone could have seen that Benny
Badger was not pleased. But he contin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>ued
his work just the same. And he made
the dirt fly even more furiously than before,
because he wanted to reach the end
of the ground squirrel's tunnel before Mr.
Coyote arrived on the scene.</p>

<p>It happened that Mr. Coyote was stalking
slowly across the country in the moonlight,
headed for no place in particular.
So Benny Badger had time to burrow his
way to the ground squirrel's bedroom
without being interrupted.</p>

<p>And then Benny met with a sad disappointment.
The owner of the burrow was
not at home! Benny knew that he could
not have been gone long, because the bed
of dried grasses was still warm.</p>

<p>It was plain that Mr. Ground Squirrel
had awakened and heard the sound of
Benny Badger's digging. And there was
no doubt that he had sprung up in a hurry
and rushed out of his back door, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
Benny made his way through the front
one.</p>

<p>Benny Badger tried to console himself
with the thought that anyhow he had had
the fun of digging. But he was very
hungry. And there was no supper in
sight anywhere.</p>

<p>He was just about to renew his search
for fresh ground squirrels' holes, when
who should appear but Mr. Coyote himself,
with a knowing smile upon his narrow
face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>MR. COYOTE SINGS</h3>


<p>Benny Badger was not at all glad to see
Mr. Coyote. And after Benny's ill luck,
the smile upon Mr. Coyote's face made
the disappointed digger feel almost peevish.</p>

<p>"What a beautiful evening it is!" said
Mr. Coyote. "And what a fine night for
digging!"</p>

<p>Benny Badger glared at the newcomer,
making no attempt to hide his displeasure
at seeing him.</p>

<p>"I don't notice <i>you</i> doing any digging,"
he remarked with a sneer. He had
no use for Mr. Coyote, and he did not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
mind letting that tricky fellow know it,
either.</p>

<p>But Mr. Coyote was not one to take a
hint. If he knew he wasn't wanted anywhere,
it never made the slightest difference
to him. And when Benny as much
as told him that he was <i>too lazy</i> to dig a
hole, Mr. Coyote did not lose his temper
even for a moment.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I seldom dig," he replied. "I
don't want to spoil your fun. If I went
to work and dug and dug anywhere
and everywhere there'd soon be nothing
but holes, no matter where you went.
You'd have no place to dig a hole yourself.
And then you'd be pretty unhappy."</p>

<p>Benny Badger hadn't thought of that.
And he didn't know just what to say, because
if Mr. Coyote meant what he said,
Benny wanted to say something <i>pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>;</i>
and if Mr. Coyote was only joking, Benny
wanted to say something disagreeable.
But before Benny had made up his mind
how to reply to Mr. Coyote's remark, his
noisy friend began talking again.</p>

<p>"Besides," Mr. Coyote added, "I
haven't time for digging, because I have
to practice singing.... If you don't
mind, I'll practice a song right now."</p>

<p>And without waiting to find out whether
Benny Badger did mind or not, Mr.
Coyote began singing in the harshest of
voices:</p>


<div class='center'><span class="smcap">The Coyote's Song</span></div>

<div class='poem'>
When Mr. Sun has gone to bed to seek his needed rest,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">And Mr. Moon has climbed the skies to flood the plains with light,</span><br />
And Mrs. Wind blows softly from the foothills in the west,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I love to sing my <i>yip-ky, oodle-doodle</i> in the night.</span><br />
<br />
When morning comes I hurry home, to take my daily nap;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when the spooky shadows fall and all the world is dark,</span><br />
Oh! then's the time I'm wide awake and ready with a <i>yap</i>,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happy, yappy <i>yip-ky, oodle-doodle</i>, and a bark.</span><br />
<br />
And none that hears my lovely voice, when startled from a dream,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Will soon forget how I begin my chorus with a growl;</span><br />
Nor how I quickly run the scale, to end it with a scream,<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span><span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happy, yappy <i>yip-ky, oodle-doodle</i>, and a howl.</span><br />
<br />
Let them that do not know my ways cry fearfully for help,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And shake and shiver when they hear my loud and lusty call;</span><br />
While I will merely jeer at them with something like a yelp,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happy, yappy <i>yip-ky, oodle-doodle</i>, and a squall.</span><br />
<br />
And now I will explain to you&mdash;perhaps you've guessed before<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The lesson that I always strive with might and main to teach&mdash;</span><br />
If you would frighten timid folk, alarm them with a roar,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A happy, yappy, <i>yip-ky, oodle-doodle</i>, and a screech.</span><br />
</div>

<p>"How do you like that?" Mr. Coyote
asked with a grin, when he had finished.</p>

<p>"Not very well!" said Benny Badger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Coyote looked just the least bit
crestfallen.</p>

<p>"Perhaps I haven't practiced the song
as much as I should," he remarked. And
thereupon he started to sing it again.</p>

<p>But Benny Badger stopped him
quickly.</p>

<p>"Don't!" he cried. And he held his
paws, dirty as they were, over his ears, as
if he couldn't bear to hear that song another
time.</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote smiled agreeably.</p>

<p>"I see," he said easily. "You don't enjoy
music as I do. But I believe we have
one taste in common."</p>

<p>"What's that?" Benny Badger asked
him; for in spite of his paws being over
his ears, he heard what Mr. Coyote said.
"What's that?"</p>

<p>"Ground Squirrels!" Mr. Coyote replied,
licking his chops as he spoke.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<h3>SPEAKING OF GROUND
SQUIRRELS</h3>


<p>Benny Badger stared none too pleasantly
at Mr. Coyote. He didn't like his visitor.
And he wished Mr. Coyote would go
away.</p>

<p>But Mr. Coyote seemed to be in no
hurry to leave. On the contrary, he appeared
to have plenty of time to spare.
And if he noticed the frown on Benny
Badger's face, he certainly acted as if it
were the most agreeable of smiles.</p>

<p>"We were speaking of Ground Squirrels&mdash;&mdash;"
he began with a smirk.</p>

<p>Benny Badger interrupted him quickly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"We were not!" he snapped. "I
haven't <i>mentioned</i> Ground Squirrels," he
growled.</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote fell back a few steps.</p>

<p>"Well, I know you're <i>interested</i> in
them, anyhow," he continued, trying to
act as if he were quite unruffled by Benny's
rudeness. "You can't deny that,
for unless I'm mistaken, you've just
caught one here." And his bright eyes
twinkled, for he thought he "had" Benny
Badger there, and it would be of no use
for Benny to deny it.</p>

<p>"You are mistaken," Benny Badger
grunted.</p>

<p>At that Mr. Coyote shot a swift look at
him. Was that a shadow of disappointment
about Benny's mouth?</p>

<p>"Did he get away from you?" Mr.
Coyote inquired.</p>

<p>Benny Badger had to admit that that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
was exactly the case. He explained how
he had found the Ground Squirrel's bed
warm, but empty, when he reached the
snug bedroom.</p>

<p>"I don't see how it happened," he told
Mr. Coyote mournfully.</p>

<p>That crafty fellow gave a short laugh.
He rather believed he knew where the
trouble lay. And he said to himself&mdash;under
his breath&mdash;that Benny Badger was
even more stupid than he had supposed.</p>

<p>"Did you keep an eye on the Ground
Squirrel's back door?" he inquired. And
he was so amused by something or other
that he began to giggle.</p>

<p>Benny Badger was afraid that Mr.
Coyote was going to burst into song
again. And he couldn't help shuddering.</p>

<p>"Are you going to sing?" he asked
hastily.</p>

<p>"I hadn't intended to," Mr. Coyote an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>swered.
"But of course if you want me
to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No! no!" Benny cried. "Please
don't!"</p>

<p>"Very well!" his musical friend replied.
And then he returned to his question.
"What about the back door? Did
you watch it carefully?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"How could I?" Benny demanded,
with a snort of anger. "I can't dig away
at a Ground Squirrel's hole, with my head
buried in it, and watch his back door at
the same time. If I stopped digging, and
went around to the back door, he'd be almost
sure to run out through the front
one. So I'd be no better off. In fact, I'd
be worse off; for I'd lose not only the
Ground Squirrel, but the fun of digging,
too."</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote turned his head away and
smiled a wide, wide smile. It was some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
moments before he could trust himself to
speak without laughing right in Benny
Badger's face.</p>

<p>"It's plain," he said at last, "that you
need help. So I'm coming here every
night to assist you in the business of
catching Ground Squirrels."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VI</h2>

<h3>STRANGE PARTNERS</h3>


<p>Mr. Coyote's plan for helping him catch
Ground Squirrels did not please Benny
Badger in the least. Up to that time he
had always had fair luck hunting alone.
And he said as much to Mr. Coyote, in
none too friendly a tone.</p>

<p>Though Benny thought he had made
his feelings plain enough, it seemed as if
Mr. Coyote couldn't take a hint. So far
was he from guessing that Benny did not
care for his scheme that he even suggested
that it might be a good idea if he brought
a half dozen of his brothers along with
him. He was very cheerful about the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
whole affair&mdash;was Mr. Coyote. Indeed,
he appeared quite ready to arrange
Benny Badger's business, without ever a
"By your leave," or "If you don't mind."</p>

<p>But Benny Badger was no person to
stand quietly by and let a scamp like Mr.
Coyote spoil his whole life. He shook his
head in a most obstinate fashion, giving
his visitor fair warning not to go too far.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, don't bring any
of your brothers here!" Benny Badger
shouted. "I never could stand a crowd
of your relations. It's bad enough to
have to listen to your six brothers when
they're half a mile away."</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote took no offence at that remark.</p>

<p>"Very well!" he replied. "No doubt
they'd want to sing if they came here to
help you. And certainly their singing
would interfere with your digging&mdash;for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of course you'd want to stop and listen to
it."</p>

<p>Benny Badger's only comment sounded
somewhat like "Humph!" But Mr.
Coyote must have thought that Benny
agreed with him. At least, he nodded his
head. And he went on to say that he
would be glad to help Benny alone, without
calling on his brothers.</p>

<p>Benny Badger made no further objection.
To be sure, having one of the Coyote
family with him every night would be bad
enough. But it was so much better than
having seven of them that he began to feel
almost pleased. Perhaps he was lucky,
after all! And besides, he thought that
when Mr. Coyote came to help him catch
Ground Squirrels that good-for-nothing
scamp would soon tire of digging.</p>

<p>And then a terrible uproar broke the
silence. It sounded as if a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
wolves&mdash;or maybe a thousand dogs&mdash;had
fallen to quarreling a mile away, growling
and howling in the distance.</p>

<p>As soon as he heard the noise Mr.
Coyote pricked up his ears and sprang to
his feet. "I must leave you now," he
said. "There are my six brothers! They're
going to have a sing. And I promised that
I'd join them.... Don't forget!" he
added, as he flung a sly smile in Benny
Badger's direction. "I'll be here soon
after dark to-morrow night."</p>

<p>And the next moment he was gone.</p>

<p>Benny Badger stood and watched him
as he loped off across the moonlit plain.
And not long afterward a terrific racket&mdash;twice
as loud as the one before&mdash;made
Benny bury his head in the place where
he had been digging.</p>

<p>"Mr. Coyote has joined his six brothers,"
he said to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>MR. COYOTE REMEMBERS</h3>


<p>The next evening, just at dusk, Benny
Badger left his den and set forth on his
usual nightly ramble.</p>

<p>By way of exercise, and for the sake of
the fun it gave him, and to improve his appetite,
he dug a few holes. And by the
time it was dark he was hungry as a bear
and ready to look once more for fresh
holes made by Ground Squirrels.</p>

<p>He had decided not to wait for Mr.
Coyote to join him, before beginning his
search. And he even hoped that Mr.
Coyote had forgotten all about his promise
to meet him and help him hunt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>But Benny Badger was to have no such
good fortune as that. It was not long before
he heard Mr. Coyote calling to him.
And though he made no answer, thinking
that Mr. Coyote might not be able to find
him, in a few minutes that sharp-faced
gentleman came bounding up at top
speed.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" he cried, as soon as he
spied Benny Badger. "I see you started
out without waiting for me. You didn't
think I'd disappoint you, did you?"</p>

<p>"I was afraid you wouldn't," Benny
answered&mdash;a remark that Mr. Coyote
seemed not to understand. For a moment
or two he looked somewhat puzzled. But
he decided, evidently, that Benny <i>meant</i>
to be pleasant, but didn't know how to
be.</p>

<p>"Now, then," Mr. Coyote said, while
Benny Badger shuddered at his harsh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
voice, "now then, where <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'you do'">do you</ins> think we'd
better look for a hole?"</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, don't howl so loud!"
Benny Badger besought him. "You'll
waken all the Ground Squirrels in the
neighborhood if you're so noisy."</p>

<p>"Pardon me!" said Mr. Coyote very
meekly, lowering his voice, but promptly
raising it again. "Do you know of any
fresh holes around here?"</p>

<p>Benny Badger said that he didn't.</p>

<p>"Then you'd better hunt for one at
once," Mr. Coyote declared, sitting down
on his haunches as if he hadn't the slightest
notion of doing any of the searching
himself. "While you're looking, I'll sing
a little song," he announced.</p>

<p>"You needn't trouble yourself to do
that," Benny Badger told him hastily.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's no trouble at all, I assure
you," Mr. Coyote replied.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;don't you do it, anyhow,"
Benny warned him. "If you sing, you'll
spoil everything, because I shall not be
able to look for any hole."</p>

<p>"I see," said Mr. Coyote, looking more
than pleased. "You'd want to stop and
listen to me, of course."</p>

<p>"It's not that," Benny Badger corrected
him. "I may as well tell you that
I don't like your songs at all."</p>

<p>"I have some that you've never heard,"
Mr. Coyote explained.</p>

<p>"I don't want to hear them," Benny
Badger informed him. "I may as well
tell you that your songs drive me almost
crazy."</p>

<p>It would not have been surprising if
Mr. Coyote had flown into a great rage.
But he did not. Instead, he pretended to
wipe a tear away from each of his eyes.
"It's a pity"&mdash;he sighed&mdash;"it's a pity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
that you don't understand music. Some
time I will teach you to sing&mdash;with the
help of my six brothers."</p>

<p>Benny Badger showed no joy over that
promise. But he felt relieved when Mr.
Coyote agreed not to sing that night. And
then Benny set out alone to look for a
fresh Ground Squirrel's hole, leaving Mr.
Coyote with his face hidden in his pocket-handkerchief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>VIII</h2>

<h3>A WATCHER AND A WORKER</h3>


<p>Benny Badger searched for some time before
he found a Ground Squirrel's hole
that looked as if its owner had finished it
only a day or two before.</p>

<p>The place was so far from the spot
where Benny had left Mr. Coyote that he
did not believe he could call loudly enough
for his helper to hear him.</p>

<p>For a few moments Benny thought
that perhaps he ought to go back and tell
Mr. Coyote that he had found a good place
to dig. But he soon changed his mind.</p>

<p>"I'll just begin digging and say nothing,"
he remarked to himself. "And per<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>haps
I can catch this Ground Squirrel
without Mr. Coyote's help."</p>

<p>So he set to work. But he hadn't dug
very far into the hole before he heard Mr.
Coyote's voice close behind him. That
sly fellow had been following him all the
time.</p>

<p>"I hope the owner of this hole is at
home," Mr. Coyote ventured.</p>

<p>At those words Benny Badger backed
out of the hole and turned around.</p>

<p>"I'll let you dig a while," he said generously.</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote thanked him. But he answered
that he couldn't think of accepting
Benny Badger's offer.</p>

<p>"I know you would be disappointed not
to do the digging yourself," he explained.
"And besides, you're a better digger than
I am. So I'll let you tear this tunnel
open, while I go around to the back door<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
and watch.... You know, I have a very
sharp eye."</p>

<p>Benny Badger looked at Mr. Coyote
narrowly. It occurred to him that <i>both</i>
Mr. Coyote's eyes were very sharp. Furthermore,
his nose was sharp, too. And
so were his teeth. Yes! on the whole,
Benny thought, Mr. Coyote appeared to
be an exceedingly sharp person.</p>

<p>"Very well!" Benny told him at last.
"I'll do the digging, gladly&mdash;for I need
the practice that it will give me. You
see, I haven't dug more than a half-dozen
holes to-night."</p>

<p>Then he thrust his head into the opening
he had already made. But before he
had begun to throw more dirt behind him
he pulled his head out again and called to
his helper, who had moved a few steps
away.</p>

<p>"If the Ground Squirrel comes out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
through his back door, please call me at
once!" he cried.</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote nodded his head over his
shoulder and smiled.</p>

<p>"I will," he agreed. "And I'll ask you
not to forget to dig hard, because you
know I'll be watching hard. And it
wouldn't be fair for one of us to do less
work than the other."</p>

<p>Benny Badger replied that in his opinion
Mr. Coyote's statement was in every
way reasonable.</p>

<p>And then he began to dig.</p>

<p>Benny would have made better time had
he not stopped every few minutes to listen;
for he did not want to miss hearing
Mr. Coyote's call.</p>

<p>But his ears caught nothing more than
a chuckle from the spot where Mr. Coyote
sat on his haunches in the grass, watching.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can stand his chuckling&mdash;if only he
won't sing!" Benny said to himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>IX</h2>

<h3>A CARELESS HELPER</h3>


<p>Stopping often to listen, Benny Badger
did not reach the Ground Squirrel's chamber
half as quickly as he could have had
he done nothing but dig.</p>

<p>And when he thrust his nose into the
underground bedroom he found nobody
at home. The Ground Squirrel had fled,
leaving his nest so warm that Benny Badger
knew he could not have been gone
long.</p>

<p>Benny turned away. But he was not
so disappointed as he might have been,
for he remembered that Mr. Coyote was
watching the back door. And certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
no Ground Squirrel could escape his sharp
eyes.</p>

<p>Hurrying as fast as his short legs would
carry him, Benny joined Mr. Coyote, who
still sat comfortably on his haunches.</p>

<p>To Benny's surprise, his helper's eyes
were closed, instead of being fixed on the
Ground Squirrel's back door.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of the Ground
Squirrel?" Benny demanded anxiously.</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote started, and opened his
eyes.</p>

<p>"Somebody came out a few moments
ago," he replied. "But he disappeared
in no time."</p>

<p>"That's too bad!" Benny Badger
wailed. "He got away!"</p>

<p>"Are you sure?" Mr. Coyote inquired.</p>

<p>"Why, yes!" Benny cried. "It's as
plain as the nose on your face."</p>

<p>"I won't dispute you," said Mr. Coyote.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd better not!" Benny Badger
snapped. "You have been very careless.
I don't believe you watched carefully
enough. When I came up just now you
had your eyes shut."</p>

<p>"I won't dispute you," said Mr. Coyote
again. He was most polite&mdash;so polite, in
fact, that Benny Badger was ashamed to
appear rude or quarrelsome.</p>

<p>But Benny couldn't help being disappointed
over losing the Ground Squirrel.
And when, after he had dug to the end of
three more tunnels that night, the same
accident happened three times more, he
decided that something would have to be
done. It was clear that Mr. Coyote's eyes
were not sharp enough. He was not
nearly so helpful as Benny had expected
him to be. "We'll have to change about,"
Benny announced at last. "You must
dig, while I watch."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mr. Coyote promptly made a number
of objections to that plan. He said,
with something quite like a sneer, that he
had much sharper eyes than any member
of the Badger family that ever lived, and
that he was quicker than a hundred Badgers
put together. And as if he hadn't
given reasons enough for disagreeing with
Benny, he declared that he simply
couldn't do any digging that night because
he had a sore paw.</p>

<p>To prove his statement, Mr. Coyote
held up one of his paws for Benny to see.</p>

<p>Benny looked at it. He couldn't discover
that it was any different from Mr.
Coyote's three remaining paws. And he
had just started to say so, too, when Mr.
Coyote interrupted him with an enormous
yawn.</p>

<p>"I'm getting sleepy," Mr. Coyote remarked.
"It will be daylight before we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
know it. And I'm going home to take a
nap."</p>

<p>So saying, he sprang up and stretched
himself. And then he trotted off. But
he stopped before he had gone far and
looked back at Benny Badger.</p>

<p>"I'll be on hand to help you again after
sunset," he said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>X</h2>

<h3>THE SORE PAW</h3>


<p>Sure enough! Just as Mr. Coyote had
promised, he was on hand the next night
to "help" Benny Badger catch Ground
Squirrels.</p>

<p>Benny regarded Mr. Coyote somewhat
coldly, as the two met in the moonlight.</p>

<p>"How's your sore paw?" he asked Mr.
Coyote.</p>

<p>Now, Mr. Coyote had just come trotting
up without the least sign of lameness. But
all at once he began to limp.</p>

<p>"My poor paw's no better," he told
Benny, as a look of pain crossed his face.</p>

<p>"Let me see it!" Benny said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>And Mr. Coyote promptly held out one
of his paws.</p>

<p>Benny Badger snorted. He seemed
quite disgusted.</p>

<p>"This is not the same paw you showed
me last night," he cried.</p>

<p>"My mistake!" said Mr. Coyote easily.
And he pulled back that paw and thrust
forth another.</p>
<div class="figleft" style="width: 277px;">
<img src="images/illus-3.jpg" width="277" height="400" alt="Benny Seized Mr. Coyote&#39;s Paw." title="Benny Seized Mr. Coyote&#39;s Paw." />
<span class="caption">Benny Seized Mr. Coyote&#39;s Paw.</span>
</div>
<p>Benny Badger bent over it for a moment.</p>

<p>"It <i>looks</i> all right," he grumbled.</p>

<p>"I can't help that," Mr. Coyote snarled.
"It couldn't hurt me any more, no matter
what happened to it."</p>

<p>To Mr. Coyote's surprise, Benny Badger
seized his paw in his powerful jaws
and held it in a viselike grip.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" Mr. Coyote wailed, pulling
back quickly&mdash;a move which only caused
him greater pain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your paw doesn't feel any worse, does
it?" Benny Badger asked him as well as
he could, with his mouth so full.</p>

<p>"Yes, it does!" Mr. Coyote howled.</p>

<p>"Then you must have been mistaken
when you said what you did only a moment
ago," Benny told him.</p>

<p>"I must have been," Mr. Coyote admitted....
"Let me go!" he begged.</p>

<p>But Benny Badger's jaws only closed
the tighter.</p>

<p>"I'll bite you if you don't stop that!"
Mr. Coyote threatened.</p>

<p>"My skin is very, very tough," Benny
said. "And I can hurt you much more
than this if I want to."</p>

<p>Mr. Coyote believed what Benny told
him. So he made no more threats, but began
to whine piteously.</p>

<p>"If you'll let me go I'll do anything
you say," he promised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Will you agree to keep away from
me?" Benny Badger asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes! Yes!" Mr. Coyote cried. "I
promise!"</p>

<p>"Good!" said Benny Badger. "I don't
need your 'help,' as you call it, any longer.
And if you ever come near me again
when I'm hunting for Ground Squirrels,
I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Benny Badger never finished what he
was saying, because he let go of Mr.
Coyote just then. And the moment Mr.
Coyote felt himself free he leaped away
and tore off on three legs as if he were
in a terrible hurry to get somewhere
else.</p>

<p>"Much help I'd ever get from him!"
Benny Badger grumbled to himself.
"He's too lazy to dig. But he isn't too
lazy to grab the Ground Squirrels that
somebody else drives out for him."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XI</h2>

<h3>BIRDS' EGGS</h3>


<p>Though Benny Badger never cared much
for foxes, he was willing, usually, to stop
and talk with one of that family&mdash;provided
he wasn't too busy digging to take
the time for gossip.</p>

<p>There was one fox who often strolled
about the neighborhood. And though
Benny had many a chat with this gentleman,
somehow Benny never learned much
from him.</p>

<p>He was so sly that he let Benny do most
of the talking, while he listened. And
when he did say anything, he preferred
to ask questions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>In time Benny Badger noticed that his
chats with Mr. Fox were very one-sided.
And he made up his mind at last that
when he next met that crafty fellow he
would ask him plenty of questions. He
would make him talk, or he would know
the reason why.</p>

<p>It happened that early on the following
morning, when he was hunting for
Ground Squirrel's holes, he found himself
face to face with Mr. Fox. And Benny
noticed that Mr. Fox was himself looking
with great interest at a fresh Ground
Squirrel's hole. "Hullo!" Benny Badger
exclaimed. "I hope you haven't come
here after Ground Squirrels."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox looked much surprised.</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" he said. "I'm only
hunting for birds' eggs."</p>

<p>"Birds' eggs!" Benny Badger repeated.
"Have you found any?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fox squirmed a bit. He did not like
to answer questions.</p>

<p>"Have you found any eggs?" Benny
asked him again.</p>

<p>"A few!" Mr. Fox replied.</p>

<p>"Where?" Benny inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, in different places," said Mr.
Fox. And he began to talk about the
weather&mdash;how dry it was, and how much
the country needed rain.</p>

<p>But Benny Badger was not to be fooled
so easily.</p>

<p>"You haven't really answered my question,"
Benny reminded Mr. Fox bluntly.
"I asked you where you've been finding
birds' eggs. And I'll thank you to tell
me, sir."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox gave a slight start. Benny's
tone was none too pleasant. And Mr.
Fox certainly didn't want to quarrel with
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you wish to know anything about
birds' eggs, why don't you ask a Prairie
Chicken?" he inquired. "She would
know a great deal more about eggs than I
do."</p>

<p>To Benny, that suggestion seemed quite
worth while. There was no doubt that
what Mr. Fox said was true. And Benny
wondered why he hadn't thought of the
plan himself.</p>

<p>"Your advice," he told Mr. Fox, "is so
good that I'm going to start right now to
look for a Prairie Chicken. It's almost
dawn now. And the Chickens will soon
be getting up."</p>

<p>So Benny said good-by. And Mr. Fox
tried to say good-by, too; but somehow he
choked over the words, and began to cough
so violently that Benny Badger was quite
alarmed.</p>

<p>He waited anxiously until he saw that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Mr. Fox was out of danger. And then he
left him.</p>

<p>If he had looked back he might have
seen his sly friend capering about in the
gray light as if something amused him
hugely. And no doubt Benny would have
wondered what it could have been.</p>

<p>"Prairie Chickens!" Mr. Fox was
chuckling. "Much they'll tell <i>him</i> about
eggs!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>THE PRAIRIE CHICKEN</h3>


<p>After he left Mr. Fox, Benny Badger
hurried here and there and everywhere in
search of a <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'pairie'">prairie</ins> chicken.</p>

<p>He found one, after a time. But the
lady wouldn't stop to talk with him. The
moment she spied Benny she <i>whirred</i> into
the air and flew off, though she certainly
must have heard him calling to her.</p>

<p>But at last, just as red streaks began
to shoot up in the eastern sky, Benny
caught sight of a stately dame who was so
busy catching grasshoppers for her breakfast
that she hadn't noticed him.</p>

<p>He did not dare go too near her, for fear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
of scaring her. So he called to her in as
gentle a tone as he could, saying, "Don't
be alarmed, madam! I only want to ask
you a question."</p>

<p>The prairie chicken stretched her neck
as high as she was able, and looked all
around.</p>

<p>"Here I am!" Benny sang out from a
grassy hummock.</p>

<p>The startled lady saw that he was not
near enough to be dangerous. So she
asked him, with a proud air, what his
question might be.</p>

<p>"I'm interested in birds' eggs," Benny
explained. "Have you any, madam?"</p>

<p>The prairie chicken took a few steps
towards him, in a very grand manner.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" she answered. "I have
a baker's dozen! They are the most beautiful
eggs I've ever seen&mdash;though perhaps
I shouldn't say so.... They're speckled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
with brownish specks," she continued.</p>

<p>"How interesting!" Benny Badger exclaimed.
"I must have a look at those
eggs. Where is your nest, madam?"</p>

<p>And just then the prairie chicken did a
strange thing. Without a word of warning
she sprang into the air and sailed
away, leaving Benny Badger to gaze after
her, and wonder why she hadn't answered
his question.</p>

<p>He soon made up his mind that he would
find her nest, anyhow.</p>

<p>Now, since there wasn't a tree anywhere
in the neighborhood, Benny felt quite sure
that the lady's nest must be on the ground.
And since he knew that all prairie chickens
slept at night, he waited until dark
before he began his search, for he wanted
to find Mrs. Prairie Chicken at home when
he called on her.</p>

<p>So when night came once more, Benny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
Badger left his den and went forth on his
errand.</p>

<p>He had gone only a short distance when
he met his old friend Mr. Fox, who had
told him a little&mdash;and very little, too&mdash;about
eggs. "Are you having any luck
to-night?" Benny Badger inquired.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Mr. Fox asked
him.</p>

<p>"Have you found any eggs?" Benny
questioned.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox said something that might
have been either "Yes" or "No." Benny
was not quite sure which it was. But
since Mr. Fox shook his head, he decided
that it must be "No."</p>

<p>"I think we're too late," Mr. Fox remarked.
"The eggs must have all hatched
by this time."</p>

<p>Benny Badger hastened to set Mr. Fox
right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"That can't be possible," he replied.
"I met Mrs. Prairie Chicken this morning
and she told me she had a baker's
dozen of eggs in her nest."</p>

<p>"You must be mistaken about that,"
Mr. Fox assured him. "Where did you
say her nest is?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say," Benny answered.</p>

<p>"No, of course not!" Mr. Fox corrected
himself. "What I meant was, where did
Mrs. Prairie Chicken say it is?"</p>

<p>"She didn't say," replied Benny Badger.</p>

<p>"That's unfortunate," Mr. Fox told
him. "It would have saved us a good deal
of trouble if she had explained where she
lives."</p>

<p>Then he told Benny Badger to go home,
and not to trouble himself any more. "<i>I</i>
will hunt for the old lady's nest," Mr.
Fox declared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>Benny Badger couldn't help thinking
that Mr. Fox was a very kind person. And
he went away feeling that it was very fine
to have a friend like him.</p>

<p>But after a while he began to wonder
if he wasn't mistaken; for he happened
to remember that Mr. Fox hadn't said a
single word about letting him know when
he had found the nest with the thirteen
eggs in it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIII</h2>

<h3>DON'T DO THAT!</h3>


<p>Benny Badger turned in his tracks and
went straight back to the place where he
had left Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>But Mr. Fox was nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p>So Benny began asking everybody he
met if he had caught a glimpse of Mr. Fox
that night. First he asked a white-footed
deer mouse, who pointed behind him and
said that he had just seen Mr. Fox "over
there." Then Benny put his question to
a frightened prairie dog, who claimed that
he had noticed Mr. Fox "over there," as
he pointed in a direction exactly opposite.
And still another reported that he had no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>ticed
Mr. Fox in an entirely different
place.</p>

<p>"That's odd!" Benny Badger said to
himself. "How can he be in three places
at once?" And since he could not answer
that question, he decided to look in none
of those three directions, but to try a
fourth, because he felt sure that none of
the three could be the right one. And besides,
if Mr. Fox had really been where
he was said to have been seen, he was such
a roving fellow that he would have moved
on.</p>

<p>Well, where he looked next, Benny
found Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>"What luck?" Benny asked that wily
gentleman once more.</p>

<p>Mr. Fox replied somewhat stiffly that
he had nothing to say.</p>

<p>"What's that on your mouth?" Benny
Badger demanded suddenly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fox hastily rubbed his paw across
his mouth.</p>

<p>"It can't be egg," he blurted.</p>

<p>"<i>Egg!</i>" Benny Badger shouted. "I
hadn't mentioned <i>egg!</i> But now that <i>you</i>
mention <i>egg</i>, perhaps that's it."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox looked most ill at ease. But
he made no reply.</p>

<p>"What's that clinging to your shoulder?"
asked Benny Badger abruptly.</p>

<p>"It can't be a feather," said Mr. Fox,
nervously brushing off his shoulder as he
spoke.</p>

<p>"A feather!" Benny Badger exclaimed.
"I've said nothing about a <i>feather!</i> But
now that you speak of it, Mr. Fox, perhaps
that's it."</p>

<p>Mr. Fox looked very, very uncomfortable.
And he murmured something about
"having to be on his way."</p>

<p>"Wait a moment!" said Benny, as Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Fox turned aside. "What's that on the
back of your neck?"</p>

<p>Mr. Fox tried in vain to look at the
back of his own neck.</p>

<p>"It can't be&mdash;&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>But before he could finish, Benny Badger
interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is!" he cried. "It's my teeth!"</p>

<p>And so saying, he seized Mr. Fox on
the back of his neck and began to drag
him over the grass.</p>

<p>It became clear, at once, that Mr. Fox
did not enjoy the sport.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, friend!" he begged.
"What are you trying to do, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying to rub the egg off your
mouth," Benny Badger explained.</p>

<p>"Please don't trouble yourself," said
Mr. Fox.</p>

<p>Then Benny began to shake him.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, friend!" said Mr. Fox<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
again. "What are you trying to do?"</p>

<p>"I'm only trying to shake the feather
off you," Benny told him.</p>

<p>"Don't trouble yourself," said Mr.
Fox. "If you'll take those teeth off my
neck, that's all I'll ask of you."</p>

<p>"Not yet!" Benny Badger replied
grimly. "You're a robber. And I'm going
to teach you a lesson.... You <i>will</i>
rob birds' nests, will you?"</p>

<p>To his great surprise, Mr. Fox began
to laugh.</p>

<p>"Why, you'd rob them yourself if you
weren't so clumsy!" he cried. "You're
really no better than I am."</p>

<p>Benny Badger hadn't thought of that.
And the idea surprised him so much that
his mouth fell open. And of course Mr.
Fox at once leaped aside and ran off.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIV</h2>

<h3>A QUEER DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>No one would ever have called Benny
Badger a great traveller. He was altogether
too heavy to roam far from home
upon his short legs. So it often happened
that he did not know all that went
on in the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Of course, his watchful eyes took in almost
everything that was in sight of his
den. But as for what was taking place
just beyond the next rise, that was an entirely
different matter. Unless somebody
chanced to stop and gossip with Benny,
sometimes several days would pass before
he knew what his neighbors were doing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>Luckily, Benny Badger kept his ears
open, when he was awake.</p>

<p>And often he kept them half-open when
he lay half-asleep, stretched out in the
grass not too far from his den, enjoying a
sun-bath.</p>

<p>One day when he was sunning himself
the sound of voices snatched him out of
his drowsiness. And he kept quite still,
to see what he could see, and hear what
he could hear.</p>

<p>Soon three coyotes came sneaking
through the grass, talking in hushed
voices&mdash;a thing they seldom did. Benny
could hardly believe his own ears, because
he had supposed that if the coyote family
spoke at all, they always howled.</p>

<p>But if the quietness of the coyotes surprised
Benny, what they said astonished
him a great deal more. For Benny Badger
learned that the three cronies were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
headed for a prairie dog village just beyond
the next rise.</p>

<p>That was most amazing news. Benny
Badger hadn't known that there was a
prairie dog village so near his den. And
for a moment he was tempted to call to
the coyotes and ask them if what they
said was really true or if they were only
fooling.</p>
<div class="figright" style="width: 276px;">
<img src="images/illus-2.jpg" width="276" height="400" alt="Mr. Owl greets Benny very coldly." title="Mr. Owl greets Benny very coldly." />
<span class="caption">Mr. Owl greets Benny very coldly.</span>
</div>
<p>But he didn't think the three prowlers
had seen him. So there seemed to be no
reason for their saying what wasn't so.</p>

<p>Well, the moment they disappeared,
Benny Badger jumped up and hurried
into his den. He would have followed the
coyotes, but he decided it would be better
to wait. The prairie dogs would be too
wary, with those coyotes in their village.</p>

<p>But later, after the coyotes had left&mdash;ah!
then he would pay a visit to the village
himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Towards evening Benny Badger crept
out of his den and followed the trail of
the three coyotes. And sure enough!
when he reached the top of the rise he
saw the mounds of the prairie dogs spread
out before him.</p>

<p>Though he saw no prairie dogs, he noticed
an owl sitting upon a heap of earth
that had been tossed out around a hole.</p>

<p>Benny Badger strolled up to the owl.</p>

<p>"It's a fine evening!" said Benny.</p>

<p>The owl merely stared at him, round-eyed,
and made no reply.</p>

<p>"I say, it's a fine evening!" Benny repeated
in a louder tone.</p>

<p>"Very well!" the owl replied. "You
may say it as often as you wish. I'm
sure I have no objection.... But you
don't need to come any nearer," he added.</p>

<p>Benny Badger stopped and squatted in
the grass. He was glad to rest, for he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>&mdash;as
has been said&mdash;no great traveller.</p>

<p>"Is anybody at home?" he asked presently.</p>

<p>"Somebody is," said the owl.</p>

<p>"Then I'll dig right in as soon as I get
my breath," said Benny Badger, glancing
at the hole.</p>

<p>"Do you want to see somebody?" the
owl asked. "For if you do, there's no
need of your doing any digging here."</p>

<p>"Why not?" Benny inquired.</p>

<p>"I'm somebody," the owl informed
him. "I live here; and I'll be disgusted
if you go to tearing my house to pieces."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XV</h2>

<h3>BENNY AND THE OWL</h3>


<p>Benny Badger smiled at the owl. He
thought he must be fooling.</p>

<p>"You're a joker, aren't you?" said
Benny. "But I never should have
thought it&mdash;you look so glum."</p>

<p>The owl seemed somewhat displeased.</p>

<p>"I've never made a joke yet," he declared,
"though I've no doubt I could, if
I should ever want to."</p>

<p>Benny Badger glanced from the owl to
the hole, and then back again at the
strange fellow.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you live here,
in this hole?" Benny exclaimed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly; I do," the owl replied
sharply.</p>

<p>Benny Badger couldn't understand
how that could be.</p>

<p>"But this is a prairie dog house," he
protested.... "Where's the chap that
built it? He must be around here somewhere."</p>

<p>"I don't know where he is, and I don't
care where he is," the owl answered. "I
drove him out of this house because I
wanted to live here myself. And I didn't
trouble myself to see where he went."</p>

<p>Benny Badger could hardly believe what
the owl told him. But he noticed that the
fellow had a sharp beak, and sharp claws
too.</p>

<p>"I should think you played a joke on
the prairie dog," he remarked at last.</p>

<p>"Should you?" said the owl. "If it
<i>was</i> a joke, it wasn't nearly as big a one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
as I'll play on anybody that tries to drive
<i>me</i> away from here.... I drove a snake
away yesterday," he added. And he
looked very thoughtfully at Benny Badger,
as if he were picking out a soft place
in which to sink his cruel beak.</p>

<p>"You needn't be so touchy," said
Benny. "I'm not going to disturb you.
I'm sure I shouldn't care to live in your
house."</p>

<p>The owl was a peppery fellow. He
grew angry at once.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he demanded. "What's
the matter with my house?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you," Benny replied. "It's a
second-hand one. And that's bad enough.
But it would be still worse if I took it
away from you, because then it would be
third-hand."</p>

<p>The owl looked daggers at him.</p>

<p>"You've insulted me!" he cried loudly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
swelling himself up&mdash;or so it seemed.</p>

<p>"Have I?" Benny Badger inquired.
"Don't mention it! I'm sure you're quite
welcome." To tell the truth, he had not
the least idea what the owl meant.</p>

<p>Naturally, Benny's words only made
the owl angrier than ever. And he became
actually rude.</p>

<p>"If I were you," he spluttered, "until
I learned better manners I would dig a
hole somewhere, crawl inside it, and pull
it in after me."</p>

<p>Now, that was a new idea&mdash;for Benny
Badger. And he liked it.</p>

<p>"What fun that would be!" he exclaimed.
"Then when I wanted to go out
I'd have to dig my way again!"</p>

<p>The owl gave a queer cry. And looking
quite discouraged, he flew off and left
Benny Badger sitting there in the grass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVI</h2>

<h3>SPOILING A GAME</h3>


<p>Though the owl left him in such a rude
fashion, Benny Badger wasted no time in
thinking about what had just happened.
There was something far more worth
while that claimed his thoughts. For the
prairie dog village still remained where
it had been. And as Benny looked at it
he found it highly interesting.</p>

<p>Even as he glanced at the doorway of
the nearest house he caught sight of a
small head with bulging eyes, which
stared at him without blinking.</p>

<p>Benny moved nearer. And the head
promptly vanished.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Benny Badger smiled all over his
face.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed. "Here's somebody
else at home!" And he looked all
around at a number of other doorways.
To his great delight he saw other eyes
peeping at him.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of 'em at home!" Benny
cried with great glee.</p>

<p>He never felt happier in all his life.
Everything was exactly as he would have
wished it. And he was just taking off his
coat, and trying to decide where he would
begin to dig, when something happened
that made him look very peevish. And he
slipped his coat on again, and lay flat in
the grass.</p>

<p>A coyote had come bounding up at exactly
the wrong time! And every one of
the prairie dogs promptly pulled his head
out of sight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>If he noticed Benny at all, the coyote
must have thought him no more than a
heap of dirt. Anyhow, he paid no heed
to Benny, but went stalking through the
village with his tongue hanging out of his
mouth, looking sharply out of the corners
of his eyes at the houses he passed.</p>

<p>There is no denying that Benny Badger
was displeased. He wanted no sneaking
coyote at hand to spoil his plans. And
he was all ready to growl, when something
made him change his mind and close his
mouth.</p>

<p>The coyote walked through the village
and disappeared in the distance. And
here and there heads soon began to appear
in doorways.</p>

<p>But when Benny Badger stood up and
drew nearer to them, they dropped down
again.</p>

<p>The next moment a very angry lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
rushed up and began scolding Benny Badger
at the top of her voice. It was Mrs.
Coyote. "Go away from this village!" she
shrieked. "You're spoiling our hunting!"</p>

<p>"Whose hunting?" Benny Badger
asked her.</p>

<p>"Mine and my husband's!" she snapped.
"That was my husband that passed
by here a few minutes ago. Of course we
know the Prairie Dogs will all hide when
they see him. But they're so silly that
they're sure to bob up and stare at him
after he has gone along. And then"&mdash;she
said&mdash;"then's the time I dash up and
grab them."</p>

<p>Mrs. Coyote paused and glared at
Benny Badger. "You've spoiled my
game," she said. "You went and showed
yourself. And when they saw you, the
Prairie Dogs hid again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>Benny Badger looked at Mrs. Coyote
pleasantly enough.</p>

<p>"Why don't you dig for them?" he
asked.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Coyote didn't appear to care
for that idea in the least. She threatened
Benny Badger with dreadful things, if
he didn't leave at once. And then she hurried
on to find her husband.</p>

<p>Benny Badger was glad to see her go.
He was not at all afraid either of Mr. or
Mrs. Coyote&mdash;nor of both of them together.
And though he had spoiled their
game, he hardly thought that they would
be able to spoil his.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XVII</h2>

<h3>THE PRAIRIE DOG VILLAGE</h3>


<p>Having once found his way to the prairie
dog village, Benny Badger often visited
it.</p>

<p>And it is said, by those who know, that
while he was there he always had a much
pleasanter time than the villagers themselves.</p>

<p>So little did the prairie dogs enjoy
Benny Badger's society that whenever
one of them spied Benny nearing the
settlement he never failed to jerk his tail
up and down and call out the news.</p>

<p>At the sound of the alarm&mdash;a high-pitched
chatter&mdash;every prairie dog who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
wasn't at home scurried for his hole as
fast as he could scamper.</p>

<p>Benny Badger always had to smile when
he saw the villagers tumbling through
their doorways. They couldn't have done
anything that would have suited him better.
Had there been a single one among
the prairie dogs that wasn't a dunce he
would have run <i>away</i> from his hole, outside
the village, to hide somewhere until
Benny Badger left the place.</p>

<p>But the prairie dogs were too stupid to
think of such a trick. They knew no better
than to rush into their houses&mdash;which
was exactly what Benny Badger wanted
them to do.</p>

<p>And if anything happened now and
then to make matters specially unpleasant
for the prairie dogs, it never troubled
Benny Badger. He seemed to grow fatter
and happier than ever as time passed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>But at last he heard a bit of news one
day that made him feel quite glum.</p>

<p>A young deer mouse claimed to have
overheard a rancher talking&mdash;the rancher
that lived about a mile from Benny Badger's
home. And the deer mouse reported
that the man was going to get rid of
the whole prairie dog family. "He says
they eat too much grass, and dig too many
holes," the deer mouse declared.</p>

<p>Though the news upset Benny, and
quite took away his appetite, for a few
moments, he began to cast about for a way
to prevent such a sad affair. If you could
have seen him with a worried look on his
face, anxiously asking everybody he met
to give him advice, you would have
thought that he felt very, very sorry for
the prairie dogs.</p>

<p>But such was not the case at all. Benny
Badger was feeling sorry for himself; for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
he knew that if the rancher drove the villagers
away he would miss them terribly.
Benny had almost given up hope of
finding a way to put an end to the rancher's
plan when the deer mouse told him
another bit of news.</p>

<p>"He's going to build a new fence out
this way&mdash;the rancher is!" the deer mouse
informed Benny. "It's coming this side
of the Prairie Dog village. And that's
why the rancher wants to get rid of the
Prairie Dogs."</p>

<p>"How do you know this?" Benny Badger
asked his small friend. "Have you
been eavesdropping again?"</p>

<p>The deer mouse blushed. And since he
made no reply, Benny Badger had to believe
him.</p>

<p>Still, Benny could see no way out of his
difficulty. And he went home at day-break
feeling quite out of sorts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>But when he awoke, right in the middle
of the day, a happy thought popped into
his head.</p>

<p>He was so excited by it that he couldn't
go to sleep again, though the sun was shining
brightly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<h3>SAVING THE DAY</h3>


<p>Benny Badger kept his bright idea to
himself. But his neighbors knew that he
must have thought of something, because
he seemed so good-natured all at once.</p>

<p>"He has a secret," they told one another.
But they couldn't find out what it
was. Though they asked Benny Badger
point blank what he intended to do, he refused
to tell them. He only smiled, and
looked very wise. And indeed he felt just
as wise as he looked.</p>

<p>For a time a good many of his friends
spied upon him. Hidden behind whatever
was handy, they watched Benny Badger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>But they soon grew tired of that. So
far as they could see, he did nothing but
dig holes. And certainly that was nothing
new for him. So his friends went
about their own affairs, leaving Benny to
dig as many holes as he pleased.</p>

<p>Now, it pleased him to dig more holes,
and bigger holes, than he had ever dug
before. And he dug them all on the <i>other</i>
side of the prairie dog village&mdash;on the
side toward the rancher's home.</p>

<p>Benny seemed to have no fixed plan as
to <i>how</i> he should dig the holes&mdash;whether
in a straight row, or in a circle, or any
other way. His one idea seemed to be to
dig a plenty&mdash;to dig as many as anybody
could possibly want for any purpose whatsoever.</p>

<p>Now and then some passer-by would
stop and look at Benny for a few minutes,
and snicker.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you looking for buried gold?" Mr.
Coyote asked him.</p>

<p>"What's the matter&mdash;have you been
digging so fast that you can't stop?" Mr.
Fox inquired.</p>

<p>Even the prairie dogs&mdash;timid as they
were&mdash;ventured to jeer at Benny Badger
and demanded whether he had gone
crazy. But Benny Badger never paused
to answer anybody. He smiled a good
deal, however, as if he knew something
that nobody else suspected.</p>

<p>Every morning at dawn he went home
to rest. And every evening at sunset he
returned to the same place, just beyond
the prairie dog village, to take up his
work where he had left it.</p>

<p>The only remark Benny would make
when anyone insisted on talking with him
was that he couldn't waste his time gossiping,
because <i>he had to save the day</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>That seemed a strange statement. No
one knew exactly what Benny Badger
meant by it. To be sure, he saved each
day for sleeping&mdash;for he worked only at
night. But it was just as true that he
saved each night for working. So it was
only natural that people should be puzzled.</p>

<p>To everybody's surprise, Benny stopped
his work as suddenly as he had begun it.
Exactly at midnight he paused, brushed
the dirt off himself, and slipped into his
coat, remarking that he thought he "had
saved the day."</p>

<p>With a hungry look on his face he
turned toward the prairie dog village.
And there was a great scurrying then.</p>

<p>"You ought to thank me!" Benny Badger
called to the prairie dogs as they dived
into their holes. "I've saved the day!
The rancher certainly won't try to get rid
of you now."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XIX</h2>

<h3>PLEASANT PRAISE</h3>


<p>Not one of the prairie dogs knew what
Benny Badger meant when he cried that
he "had saved the day."</p>

<p>Of course, they had heard that the
rancher did not like their village, and that
he wanted to get rid of it&mdash;and them. But
they couldn't imagine how Benny Badger
might be able to help them. Indeed,
they rather liked the rancher better than
Benny, anyhow. And as for thanking
Benny, the only time they would ever feel
like thanking him would be when he bade
them good-by and left the neighborhood,
to return no more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>But Benny Badger was quite unaware
of all that. He complained that the prairie
dogs weren't treating him well.</p>

<p>"They ought to send a committee to my
house to thank me for what I've done for
them," he grumbled. "No one around
here seems to understand me. But the
rancher certainly will. You'll see before
long that he'll be after me, to tell me what
<i>he</i> thinks of me."</p>

<p>For several days afterward Benny lost
a good deal of sleep by staying outside his
house while watching for the rancher to
appear. And little by little, from things
he said now and then, his neighbors
learned his secret.</p>

<p>They discovered that Benny Badger had
been digging holes for the posts of the
new fence that the rancher was going to
build!</p>

<p>"When he finds those holes already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
made, he won't be so foolish as to dig
others," Benny explained.</p>

<p>"But you've gone and dug them on the
wrong side of the Prairie Dog village!"
somebody objected.</p>

<p>"Of course I have!" Benny retorted.
"I did that on purpose. Don't you understand
that when the rancher finds the
holes he'll use them where they are? You
don't suppose&mdash;do you?&mdash;that he'll be so
silly as to move the holes?"</p>

<p>The objector&mdash;a somewhat youthful
coyote&mdash;slunk away with a foolish simper.
He saw that Benny Badger knew
what he was talking about.</p>

<p>"Since the Prairie Dogs' village will
lie <i>outside</i> the new fence, the rancher
won't pay any more attention to it,"
Benny Badger said stoutly. "From this
time on, the Prairie Dogs are quite safe&mdash;so
far as the rancher is concerned....<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
And that's how I have saved the day."</p>

<p>Benny Badger's secret was out at last.
And as fast as people learned it they
stopped to tell him that they had known
all the time that he had a fine plan of some
sort, and that if there was anything they
could do to help him they would be greatly
obliged if he would "count on them."</p>

<p>Of course the work was all done. But
perhaps Benny's neighbors hadn't stopped
to think of that. Anyhow he had never
known them to be so pleasant before. And
he quite enjoyed their praise; for everyone
told him that nobody had ever suspected
that he was so clever.</p>

<p>It was lucky that Benny took the time
when he did to listen to his neighbors'
pleasant speeches. Unfortunately they
soon came to a sudden end.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XX</h2>

<h3>THE RANCHER IS ANGRY</h3>


<p>Benny Badger lay motionless, with his
long hair parted along the middle of his
back and flowing off his sides in such a
fashion that a careless passer-by would
not have noticed that it was anything more
than dry grass.</p>

<p>For several days Benny had been
watching for the rancher. And now, at
last, he saw him coming, riding on a horse
over the rolling plain.</p>

<p>There was another man with the rancher.
And as soon as Benny caught the
murmur of their voices he made ready to
hear many pleasant remarks about him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>self.
He was only waiting until the riders
should discover the holes he had dug near
the prairie dog village.</p>

<p>Nearer and nearer came the men.
And Benny Badger crouched lower and
lower.</p>

<p>They had passed him, and ridden a bit
nearer the village, when the rancher suddenly
pulled his horse to a stand.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Benny Badger exclaimed under
his breath. "He sees the new post-holes
that I've dug for him. And how pleased
he'll be!"</p>

<p>It was true that the rancher had just
noticed the holes for the first time. The
moment he saw them he gave a great roar.</p>

<p>"A badger!" he shouted. "We'll have
to trap him. I can't have him tearing my
ranch up like this. These holes are the
finest things in the world to break a critter's
leg in."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>Benny Badger could scarcely believe
what his own ears told him. He thought
there must be a mistake somewhere. And
when the rancher declared that the badger
that dug those holes was worse than a
whole village of prairie dogs, Benny was
tempted, for one wild moment, to dash up
to the men and tell them exactly what he
thought.</p>

<p>But he remembered, in time, what the
rancher had just said about trapping him.
And he never stirred until the two riders
had moved along.</p>

<p>When they had ridden beyond the next
rise Benny Badger made a rush for his
hole. And there he stayed all the rest of
that day.</p>

<p>He didn't quite know what to do. And
a little later he felt more uncomfortable
than ever when the rancher began to build
his new fence around the prairie dog vil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>lage,
without using a single one of the
post-holes that Benny had dug for him.</p>

<p>All Benny's neighbors noticed what was
happening. And they no longer told
Benny what a clever fellow he was. On
the contrary, they laughed slyly, and said
things to one another whenever Benny
Badger came near them.</p>

<p>When he growled at them they always
pretended to be surprised to see him, and
asked him if he had "dug any post-holes
lately."</p>

<p>But Benny Badger never answered that
question. Every time he heard it he felt
like moving away from the neighborhood.
And when he came home early one morning
and found a <i>trap</i> right in his doorway
he made up his mind then and there that
matters had gone far enough.</p>

<p>He turned away. And without stopping
to tell anybody what he intended to do, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
where he was going&mdash;without even saying
good-by&mdash;he stole away across the plains
to hunt for a new home.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXI</h2>

<h3>THE NEW HOME</h3>


<p>When Benny Badger went wandering off
to find a safer and pleasanter neighborhood
in which to make a new home for
himself, he had no idea at all as to where
he should go. He only knew that he
wanted to get a good, long distance away
from the place where he had been living.</p>

<p>Wherever he decided to settle, it must
be some spot where the ungrateful rancher
wouldn't be likely to find him, and set
a trap in his doorway again.</p>

<p>On and on Benny travelled, until at
last he met a spry young chap&mdash;one of the
deer mouse family&mdash;who stopped still and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
stared at Benny as if he would like to
speak to him, but didn't quite dare to.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said Benny Badger. "Do
you live around here?"</p>

<p>The deer mouse answered politely with
a nod, as if he would like to talk, if he
weren't too shy.</p>

<p>"Do you find this an agreeable neighborhood?"
Benny Badger inquired.</p>

<p>"Very!" the deer mouse replied in a
thin, piping voice.</p>

<p>"Is there plenty of good water nearby?"
Benny asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed!" the deer mouse exclaimed.
"There's a water-hole right
over there!" And he pointed over his
shoulder, without taking his eyes off Benny
Badger. He knew it was safer to keep
a close watch of strangers.</p>

<p>Benny sat down. He had journeyed a
long way and he was tired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll go and have a drink as soon as
I'm rested," he said. "I'm glad there's
good water here. This seems to be a pleasant
place.... Are there any good Gophers
and Prairie Dogs in the neighborhood?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" the deer mouse answered.
"But you needn't worry about them.
They won't harm you if you mind your
own affairs. I've lived here a long time;
and they haven't touched me."</p>

<p>"What about Owls?" Benny Badger
wanted to know.</p>

<p>The deer mouse looked solemn all at
once.</p>

<p>"There are a few," he admitted. "If
you're thinking of settling here, you'll
have to watch sharp for them. I've had
several narrow escapes."</p>

<p>Benny Badger smiled.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see the Owl that could hurt<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
me!" he cried. "And as for Gophers and
Prairie Dogs, <i>I like them</i>.... This is
the very place I've been looking for. And
as soon as I have rested a little longer and
had a drink of that good water I'm going
to dig myself a den right where I'm sitting
now."</p>

<p>The deer mouse pricked up his long ears
at that. To the best of his belief, no badger
had ever lived in the neighborhood before.
And if the stranger was going to
dig a hole, he intended to watch him while
he worked.</p>

<p>"If you feel rested enough now, I'll
show you the way to the water-hole," the
deer mouse said presently. He was impatient
for the fun to begin.</p>

<p>Benny Badger stood up.</p>

<p>"Lead on!" he commanded. "I'll follow."
And then he yawned&mdash;for it was
already long past his usual bedtime.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>The deer mouse trembled slightly as he
looked into Benny's great mouth. And
he took care to keep well ahead of the
stranger all the way to the water-hole, and
back again, too. But he soon forgot his
fear when Benny Badger began to dig the
new den. The dirt flew in such showers
as the deer mouse had never seen in all
his life&mdash;except during a cyclone.</p>

<p>Benny had begun to dig&mdash;as he said
he should&mdash;in the exact spot where he
had sat and rested. But for one reason
or another he soon changed his mind, and
started to dig a different hole a short distance
from the first one.</p>

<p>Soon he moved again. And after he had
begun no less than five holes, only to leave
each one unfinished, the deer mouse interrupted
him with a sharp cry.</p>

<p>"Stop! Stop!" he begged Benny.
"Please don't do that!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>Benny Badger paused and stared at him
in amazement.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked. "What's the
matter?"</p>

<p>The deer mouse was all a-flutter.</p>

<p>"Goodness me!" he exclaimed. "You'll
have the whole neighborhood dug up if
you're not careful!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<h3>A BREAKFAST INVITATION</h3>


<p>For a moment or two Benny Badger
looked at the deer mouse without saying a
word. He told himself that here was a
country person who couldn't ever have
travelled much, or he would have known
better than to make such a remark....
Spoil the whole neighborhood indeed!...
Benny's lip twisted up in something
like a sneer.</p>

<p>"Don't you worry!" he snorted. "I
don't believe you ever saw a first-class
digger before. I'm not going to spoil
the neighborhood. I'm <i>improving</i> it.
I'm making a fine house here&mdash;prob<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>ably
the finest there is for miles around."</p>

<p>The deer mouse appeared ashamed. Of
course he didn't like to seem stupid.</p>

<p>"But why do you dig in so many
places?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"That's my way," Benny Badger told
him. "As soon as I get one den well started
I think I'd rather live somewhere else.
But I don't mind beginning again because
there's no better exercise than digging."</p>

<p>"No doubt!" the deer mouse agreed.
"But I'm sure it would be much too
violent for me."</p>

<p>He said no more, but looked on with a
puzzled air until at last Benny Badger
had actually dug in one place long enough
to make a deep den.</p>

<p>When it was quite finished Benny Badger
brushed the dirt off himself and
turned to Mr. Deer Mouse.</p>

<p>"Come inside and see if my new house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
isn't the finest one you ever saw!" he said.</p>

<p>For some reason Mr. Deer Mouse did
not seem eager to enter. To be sure, he
thanked Benny for the invitation, but he
backed away a few steps and said that he
thought he'd better not look at the new
house that morning. "I&mdash;I haven't the
time to spare," he mumbled.</p>

<p>Benny Badger couldn't understand that
remark. The white-footed gentleman had
had plenty of time to spend while watching
him dig the den. And Benny said as
much, too.</p>

<p>"That's exactly the point," said the deer
mouse. "I've spent so much time already
that I've used it all up."</p>

<p>Well, Benny Badger couldn't understand
that either.</p>

<p>"Used up all the time!" he cried scornfully.
"Isn't there plenty more where the
other time came from?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, to be sure&mdash;to be sure!" said the
deer mouse, who seemed ready to agree to
anything&mdash;except to Benny's invitation.
"But there is another reason why I
mustn't visit your new home this morning:
I'm hungry. I haven't had my breakfast
yet."</p>

<p>Suddenly Benny Badger remembered
that he was hungry himself.</p>

<p>And as he stared at plump Mr. Deer
Mouse a certain idea came into his head.
And he looked Mr. Deer up and
down before he spoke.</p>

<p>"I haven't had my breakfast either,"
he said at last. "I'm ready for a good
meal. Come right in and join me!"</p>

<p>But something made Mr. Deer Mouse
say, "No, thank you!" <i>Joining a badger
at breakfast!</i> Somehow that had a dangerous
sound.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>XXIII</h2>

<h3>MR. DEER MOUSE IS TIMID</h3>


<p>Benny Badger began to lose patience
with the deer mouse. He was one of the
most timid persons Benny had ever seen.
And Benny was on the point of telling him
that he hadn't even the courage of a
prairie dog.</p>

<p>But suddenly a new idea flashed into
his head. He thought he knew what was
troubling Mr. Deer Mouse.</p>

<p>"When I asked you to join me at breakfast
I didn't mean what you thought I
did," Benny announced. "You thought&mdash;didn't
you?&mdash;that I meant to breakfast
on <i>you</i>."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Deer Mouse admitted faintly that
he had had some such notion.</p>

<p>"How ridiculous!" Benny Badger
cried. "Why, you're so quick that I could
chase you all day&mdash;and all night, too&mdash;without
catching you. You're too spry for
me. So we might as well put such an idea
out of our minds."</p>

<p>Benny Badger sighed as he spoke. And
he couldn't help noticing, once more, how
very, very plump Mr. Deer Mouse was.</p>

<p>"What I meant by your joining me at
a good meal was simply this," he continued:
"If you'll only stay with me, and
follow me quietly wherever I go, there's
a good chance that you'll have a bone to
gnaw before a great while."</p>

<p>All that seemed very pleasant to the
deer mouse.</p>

<p>"Thank you ever so much!" he murmured.
"I'll be glad to accept your invi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>tation,
so long as we aren't going to
breakfast inside your new home."</p>

<p>So they set out. And for a time Mr.
Deer Mouse followed Benny Badger all
around the neighborhood.</p>

<p>Though Benny kept a sharp watch on
all sides, he couldn't see anything&mdash;or anybody&mdash;that
promised a meal. And he decided
at last that he would have to make
a change of some sort in his plans.</p>

<p>So he sat down and beckoned to Mr.
Deer Mouse to move nearer.</p>

<p>"You go ahead of me, and I'll follow
you," he said. "You're smaller than I
am, and perhaps you won't frighten the
game the way I do."</p>

<p>Mr. Deer Mouse did not seem to care
for the suggestion.</p>

<p>"You might make a mistake," he objected.
"If I went ahead of you, you
might think that I was the game. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
there might be a terrible accident."</p>

<p>Benny Badger sniffed.</p>

<p>"Nonsense!" he cried. "If I did make
such a mistake, I promise you that I
wouldn't let it happen more than once."</p>

<p>But the deer mouse proved to be a stubborn
chap. He declined flatly to do as
Benny wanted.</p>

<p>"Very well!" said Benny Badger gruffly.
"I'm sorry that you don't care to
make things as pleasant as possible for a
newcomer. Where I used to live, people
couldn't do enough for me."</p>

<p>"I believe you," Mr. Deer Mouse retorted.
"In fact, I've heard that a man
even set a trap for you, right in your own
doorway."</p>

<p>Of course, that news came to Benny
Badger as a great surprise. He had had
no idea that Mr. Deer Mouse knew anything
about him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>"Somebody has been gossiping!" Benny
Badger growled angrily. "Who told you
that?"</p>

<p>"Goodness me! Everybody has heard
about it," Mr. Deer Mouse replied.
"Don't you know that news travels fast
over the plains?"</p>

<p>"Does it travel as fast as I do?" Benny
Badger asked him suddenly.</p>

<p>Before the words were out of his mouth
he leaped at Mr. Deer Mouse. And for
one as heavy as he was, Benny leaped
with surprising swiftness.</p>

<p>But quick as he was, he was too slow to
catch Mr. Deer Mouse napping. That
nimble fellow seemed to melt away right
beneath Benny Badger's paws.</p>

<p>For one moment Benny was sure he had
him. And the next moment he was sure
he hadn't.</p>

<p>He couldn't see his small neighbor any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>where.
In fact, it was a whole week before
Benny Badger set his eyes on him
again. And to Benny's amazement, Mr.
Deer Mouse was just as polite as ever.
He asked Benny how he liked his new
home, and if he had found the people in
the neighborhood as pleasant as he had
expected.</p>

<p>"My house is a fine one," Benny told
him. "And I dare say the neighborhood
is as good as I could expect. Certainly
there's a plenty of Gophers and Prairie
Dogs here."</p>

<p>"I suppose"&mdash;said Mr. Deer Mouse&mdash;"I
suppose some of them join you at
breakfast every morning."</p>

<p>Benny Badger looked at him sharply.
He was all ready to get angry. But Mr.
Deer Mouse was so polite, and seemed so
respectful, that Benny was ashamed to
lose his temper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>He actually winked at Mr. Deer Mouse.
And he felt more cheerful than he had
since the rancher spoke ill of him.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I moved," he told Mr. Deer
Mouse. "This is a fine place. I'm going
to live here the rest of my life."</p>

<p>And he did.</p>

<div class='blockquot2'><big>T</big>HE stories of Jolly Robin, Old Mr. Crow and the other
birds are as unusual as they are delightful, since this is
almost the first time these feathered friends of the kiddies
have appeared in print. These bird stories, like the Sleepy-Time
animal stories, are based upon actual natural history
facts, but while the youngster eagerly listens to them, a moral
foundation, of deeper importance than that in natural history,
is being laid.</div>
